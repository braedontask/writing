.INT. SAGE AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
!The apartment is a typical Stuytown squeeze: no light, cramped, and rent stabilized.

        @SAGE
    Ew. Het-norm much?

        @BRIAN
    Me?

        @SAGE
    Yes, you.

        @BRIAN
    Babe.

        @SAGE
    Don't *babe* me, straggot.

        @BRIAN
    I gag.
